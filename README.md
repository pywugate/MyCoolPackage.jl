# MyCoolPackage

## Personla Notes

Basically I followed official tuto (Ref1), and failed many times.

The key difference is that Chris use GitKraken, which seems no problem.

I used GitHub desktop and there are many problems:

1. If I created new repo, GitHubDesktop always creates subfolder :
`~\.julia\dev\MyCoolPackage\MyCoolPackage.jl`

or 

2. If I add existing repo, GitHubDesktop always got error and fais pushing (Ref2):
 
`“The repository does not seem to exist anymore. You may not have access, or it may have been deleted or renamed.”`
